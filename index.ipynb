    "## Introduction\n",
    "This module is based on a case study involving [The \"Legacy of Slavery Project\"](http://slavery.msa.maryland.gov/) archival records from the Maryland State Archives. The Legacy of Slavery in Maryland is a major initiative of the Maryland State Archives. The program seeks to preserve and promote the vast universe of experiences that have shaped the lives of Maryland’s African American population. Over the last 18 years, some 420,000 individuals have been identified and data has been assembled into 16 major databases. The [DCIC](http://dcic.umd.edu) has now partnered with the Maryland State Archives to help interpret this data and reveal hidden stories.\n",
    "\n",
    "The team of students (as part of the [Data Challenge 2019] (https://datachallenge.ischool.umd.edu/) interacted with a historical data set from the Maryland State Archives compiling the metadata of newspaper advertisements for runaway slaves, and received the **\"Best Team Presentation\" award** for this work.\n",

    "They organized their exploration around David Weintrop’s model of computation thinking (https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10956-015-9581-5.pdf) to build on the work of a previous survey of the data and other related data sets as part of the larger Legacy of Slavery project. Under the guidance of Dr. Richard Marciano, they hoped to further the University of Maryland Digital Curation Innovation Center’s (DCIC) “agenda to ‘infuse computational thinking’ into archival science,” (https://dcicblog.umd.edu/cas/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2018/12/2.Marciano.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "They applied the taxonomy to three themes: **dates, locations, and demographics**. Previous work was decently accurate in analyzing the dates of these advertisements. Thus, the team moved forward to explore the relationship between advertisement date and departure date. The prior geographic visualizations were more problematic: changing county boundaries, extensive human error and abbreviation in data transcription, and null values. Previous visualizations of demographics did not adequately clean and homogenize the data. The team was able to produce a more accurate understanding of who was running away while beginning to explore methods for isolating distinct individuals.\n",

    "## Motivation\n",
    "Students got a chance to work with the 12,000+ records from the **Runaway Slave Ads** collection.  This collection features local newspaper advertisements placed by slave owners in an attempt to retrieve their escaped slaves. The data links newspaper clippings, and fugitive, owner, and departure and destination data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project offers an opportunity to discover new insights into the patterns of fugitive slaves in Maryland, based on location, time period, and relationships. \n",
    "\n",
    "The team met challenges including the time constraints of the data challenge itself, the historical nature of the data, and the abundance of human error both in the creation of the original advertisements and in the recent crowdsourced transcriptions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Future developments include reliably cleaning and linking demographics and geographical data from the larger Legacy of Slavery project in order to tell more complete stories of enslavement, slave-based economics, and geographical migration.\n",
