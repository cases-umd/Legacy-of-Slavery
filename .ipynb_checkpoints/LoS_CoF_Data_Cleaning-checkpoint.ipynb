    "## Introduction\n",
    "This module is based on a case study involving [The \"Legacy of Slavery Project\"](http://slavery.msa.maryland.gov/) archival records from the Maryland State Archives. The Legacy of Slavery in Maryland is a major initiative of the Maryland State Archives. The program seeks to preserve and promote the vast universe of experiences that have shaped the lives of Maryland’s African American population. Over the last 18 years, some 420,000 individuals have been identified and data has been assembled into 16 major databases. The [DCIC](http://dcic.umd.edu) has now partnered with the Maryland State Archives to help interpret this data and reveal hidden stories.\n",
    "\n",
    "We, as a team of students as part of a 2-day [Datathon 2019 at Maryland State Archives](https://ai-collaboratory.net/projects/ct-los/student-led-datathon-at-the-maryland-state-archives/) interacted with the historical data set collection, \"Certificates of Freedom\" from the Maryland State Archives compiled database.\n",
    "\n",
    "We organized the data exploration and cleaning around [David Weintrop’s model of computation thinking](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10956-015-9581-5.pdf) and worked based on a [questionnaire] (TNA_Questionnaire.ipynb) developed by The National Archives, London, UK to document each step of our process. \n",
